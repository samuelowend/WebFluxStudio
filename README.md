# FluxAtlas

FluxAtlas is a solo WebFlux-inspired digital workshop that narrates the lifecycle of a miniature project discovery and prototyping routine. It generates mock Web2 and Web3 concepts, tracks the evolving story, and keeps the solo author honest about productivity. The project is intentionally story-rich so future reviews read like a journal entry instead of a canned demo.

## Purpose
- Randomly combine technology domains (Web2 tooling, Web3 finance, AI bots, scripts, and experimental utilities) to sketch plausible personal projects.
- Model the way a single developer boots up a workspace, researches the idea, sketches PR descriptions, and keeps momentum through micro-commits.
- Stay lightweight: no actual deployments, no heavy frameworks, just structured data, helpers, and notes that could one day become code.

## Structure
- `docs/`: Thought fragments, idea trackers, and planning notes for the solo effort.
- `fluxatlas/`: Core generators, models, and workspace orchestration logic.
- `scripts/`: Helpers to run the storyboard or to convert notes into shareable snapshots.

The repository is deliberately anecdotal; each helper mimics a real entry one might add while tinkering late at night.
