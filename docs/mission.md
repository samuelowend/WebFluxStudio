# Mission

FluxAtlas is the solo logbook of a weekend tinkerer. It does not deploy, but it does keep track of how the tinkerer blends various stacks, how the pacing of commits feels, and how the storyline evolves.

Each new module is treated like a short note, as if the engineer were whispering to a journal in between client calls.

Every day's recap now ends with a quick insight summary that counts domains, stacks, energy, and focus, so the solo engineer can see what kind of story arc the tinkering is drifting toward.
